## “What is Interview Preparation?”

*“Let me tell you a small story. Years ago, I mentored a student named Shubham. Bright mind, good technical skills, but nervous about interviews. He thought interview preparation meant cramming answers to 50 commonly asked questions and wearing a blazer. But when he sat in front of the interviewer, his answers felt robotic, and his confidence faded. He didn’t connect. And he didn’t get the job.*

*So one day, I asked him a simple question: ‘Shubham, do you know who you are and why you want this job?’ He paused. No answer.*

### 🎯 The Real Meaning of Interview Preparation

Interview preparation isn’t just about:

* Memorizing answers.
* Practicing handshakes.
* Repeating “I’m a quick learner.”

It's about **self-awareness + clarity + practice**.

### 🧠 1. **Know Yourself Deeply**

> *“If you don’t know your strengths, how will the interviewer?”*

Interviewers don’t want a perfect candidate. They want a **real person** who:

* Understands their own skills and gaps.
* Can explain what they enjoy and why.
* Is honest, but hopeful and committed to growth.

Encourage your students to reflect:

* What am I good at?
* What energizes me?
* What work have I enjoyed in college or projects?
* What kind of company or team do I want?

### 🧩 2. **Understand the Role and Company**

> *“You’re not just selling your skills—you’re solving their problem.”*

Interview prep means studying:

* The **job description**: What are they really looking for?
* The **company**: What do they build, what values do they have?
* The **team culture**: Do they value innovation? Collaboration? Ownership?


### 💬 3. **Practice Talking, Not Just Writing**

> *“An interview is not a written test—it’s a conversation.”*

Shubham began recording himself answering questions. Not to sound perfect, but to get comfortable **talking** about:

* His projects.
* His failures (and what he learned).
* Why he chose this field.
* What excites him about the opportunity.

He also practiced asking **intelligent questions** like:

* “What are current challenges the team is facing?”
* “How is success measured in this role?”

### 💡 4. **Storytelling Beats Theory**

> *“Tell stories, not definitions.”*

Instead of saying “I’m good at teamwork,” Shubham said:

> “In our final-year project, we faced a conflict in ideas. I initiated a group sync-up and helped us re-align based on our deadline. We finished early.”

Stories show your behavior, your values, and how you think. **They leave a mark.**

### 🎁 Bonus: Prepare Your Mindset

Interview prep also means preparing your **mind**:

* Rejections may come, but they’re part of the path.
* Each interview is a lesson, not just a test.
* Your goal is not to impress—but to express who you are clearly, confidently, and humbly.

### ✅ Shubham’s Next Interview? He Smiled More. He Connected More.

And yes, he got the job. But more than that—he finally felt he **deserved** it, not just because he practiced answers, but because he knew **who he was** and how he could contribute.
